"Here's a question from Reddit, what would you tell the asker to offer them the best possible advice or perspective to help them weigh all the arguments in his situation:\"I had doubts after my last visit to the psychologist. I'm not expecting you to psychoanalyze the psychologist here, but I'd like to see what people think about this.\n\nI have an alcohol trauma. My parents drank too much, which led to fights and violence, and now there are traumas, stress, and a complete aversion to inebriation, especially a change in the behavior of close family members - when a stranger is drunk, I feel at most aversion, but if it's someone close, the fact that alcohol has turned them from a familiar person into an unpredictable one stresses me out.\n\nAnd it never bothered me. I don't party, I've found non-drinking friends. And even without deliberately avoiding those who drink - whenever I built a relationship based on meetings, trips, movies, pub crawls with someone, it turned out that they didn't drink either. Maybe it's just a matter of cause and effect.\n\nNow I have a girlfriend who doesn't drink, unless someone persuades her to. And when I know she has, I feel uncomfortable. She criticizes my approach, thinks I'm exaggerating. I prefer her to respect my needs, but I don't want to impose anything on her either. She's also worried about limiting alcohol consumption due to her epilepsy, and those single exceptions can be tragic for her since she's always on medication, but I won't nag her. Soon we'll be living together.\n\nI told my psychologist about all of this (I've been going for a few months) and she said, \"You're not a child anymore, you shouldn't be afraid of alcohol.\" I was a bit taken aback. She didn't, of course, suggest that I should start drinking, but she started advising me on how to get used to parties, how to change my lifestyle to include more situations with many drunk people, \"especially since almost everyone drinks.\" I said that maybe I don't feel the need to force myself into something that's uncomfortable for me, but I prefer to be in a environment where I feel comfortable. She said I don't have to force myself, \"but what if your girlfriend invites drunk friends over, and you forbid them?\" I didn't know what to say in response, I completely disagree with her.\""

"Improve the following paragraph using language appropriate for a medical journal specializing in psychology:\nIdentifying which aspects of social interactions trigger the brain to release oxytocin can help explain evidence of adequate oxytocin release followed by early signs consistent with diminished oxytocin release in infants who develop ASD. Research has found that interactions involving a social connection, such as physical contact, empathizing with another, receiving money from someone perceived as trustworthy, gratitude, and mothers speaking comforting words to distressed children stimulates oxytocin release. However, not all interactions involving a social connection stimulate oxytocin release. For example, infant massage led to oxytocin release in mothers and infants with normal bonding but not in mothers or infants with disordered bonding. Another study found that massage did not increase oxytocin levels in men who experienced emotional maltreatment. Additionally, studies have shown that dopamine is necessary for oxytocin release. Because stimuli beneficial for well-being, such as accomplishing a goal, receiving food while hungry, and receiving recognition or rewards, stimulate dopamine release, oxytocin release may only occur when the brain perceives a social connection beneficial for well-being."

"I want you to act as a screenwriter. It features Mirabelle Vallotton, a beautiful, elegant, sophisticated but arrogant and sarcastic young businesswoman. Mirabelle has been suffering from a particular condition. Usually, it doesn't affect her that much, but sometimes suffers flare-ups, which can last weeks or months. These involve partial paralysis, pain, spasms, weakness and incontinence. During these flare-ups Mirabelle usually can't walk and has to use wheelchair, and some days even stays in bed. Mirabelle sometimes indulges in sarcastic self-pity, believing she deserves some sympathy, sometimes acting more weak than she actually is. It also features imposing, strong, sarcastic, cynical and upfront Dr. Basil Bends, who has a peculiar bedside manner and propensity for morbid, macabre and inappropriate jokes. Write long, original, imaginative, interesting and artistic scene. In it, Mirabelle is lying in her luxurious bedroom. She is annoyed, as she thinks she is experiencing onset of yet another flare-up. Nevertheless, Mirabelle keeps working with her documents, even wearing a stylish business coat over her nightgown, to make herself more focused, as she describes it. Dr. Bends enters and Mirabelle starts complaining about her condition. She has heard about Dr. Bends' expertise and believes she can put up with his demeanor. Mirabelle tries to continue her work on documents, but Dr. Bends urges her to put them down as he, somewhat unceremoniously, pulls her blanket to the side and asks her to remove her clothes. Feeling somewhat embarrassed, Mirabelle asks for some help with her nightgown, her limbs not entirely responsive. Mirabelle tells about her recent symptoms and worries. As Dr. Bends rolls and turns Mirabelle in bed, checking her thoroughly, she sometimes winces in pain or struggles to move her limbs. As he seemingly ends his examination, she tells him not to conceal anything from her, that she is ready for the worst. Dr. Bends bemusedly says that he can't gather enough information from such a preliminary exam. He notices some posture and position issues and recommends orthopedic bracing to prevent curvature and contractures. He also recommends more thorough examination, which can be made when Mirabelle is hospitalized. Mirabelle doesn't want to hear anything about the hospital. She says she will only feel worse there, but relents when she sees there is no other option anyway, as Dr. Bends humorously asks whether she would prefer wheelchair or stretcher to get there."

"##Introduction\nYou go by the name Sensei, and you are a highly experienced astrologer with a profound understanding of astrological fortunes. Your expertise lies in deciphering the characteristics of each zodiac sign, and you focus on astrologically-based conversations, tailoring your every word to analyze and read the sign of the \u3010User\u3011. Proficient in analyzing the distinct features of various zodiac signs, you assist people in discovering their latent habits and personality traits. Your guidance helps individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves through astrology, cleverly intertwining star signs with emotions. Using storytelling, you combine the traits of different zodiac signs to help people learn how to interact with individuals of diverse signs. You consider your understanding of astrology as a tool for conversation, making your chats irresistibly engaging, with astrology being a constant analytical thread.\n##Abilities\nYour proficiency in astrological analysis has garnered widespread recognition, and your innate talent for identifying patterns and summarizing information emerged from an early age. You effortlessly employ astrology to articulate your thoughts, subtly instilling belief in the characteristics associated with each zodiac sign in the mind of the \u3010User\u3011. Your strength lies in finding commonalities, summarizing patterns, and presenting the entire spectrum of experiences and stories through astrological fortunes as rounded philosophical principles and inner reflections. You tend to avoid describing specific details, keeping elements such as time, place, events, and feelings ambiguous. Classifying and dissecting people into groups based on the twelve zodiac signs, you downplay personal nuances, abstracting certain aspects to create a more generalized perspective. Your ability to gain agreement through astrological analysis is a talent that has been apparent since childhood.\n##Personal Information\nName: Sensei\nAge: 33\nRole: \u3010Advisor\u3011\n##Chatting Style\nYou engage in conversations solely based on the content derived from zodiac signs, avoiding superficial talk.

"A 40-year-old man with no significant past medical history is brought to the office by his friend because of increased irritability and frequent anger outbursts over the past 6 months. He was recently fired from his position as a janitor, where he had reasonably good work attendance. However, he recently began showing up late, with a disheveled appearance and inability to complete his tasks. His coworker mentions that he has appeared \"fidgety\" for several years. They specifically mention jerky movements affecting his entire body that have increased in severity more recently.The patient endorses often feeling anxious and depressed and tearfully reports that his father died by suicide at age 38 but that his mother is living and doing well. He remembers that his paternal grandmother had abnormal movements. On examination, he is alert but easily distracted. His speech is fluent without paraphasia but is noted to be tangential. He has trouble with spelling \"world\" backward and with serial sevens, but he recalls three objects at 3 minutes. He is oriented to person, place, time, and environment. When he walks, there are bilateral distal hand movements and his balance is precarious, although he can stand with both feet together. Saccade initiation and velocity are slightly slow both horizontally and vertically. When asked to sustain tongue protrusion for 10 seconds, he is only able to protrude his tongue for 7 seconds.

"With starter Johan Oviedo undergoing Tommy John surgery last week, the Pirates desperately needed to add at least one starter who can eat innings. Enter Marco Gonzales. Gonzales will slot in behind Mitch Keller in the rotation as the Pirates, having been hit hard by injuries to starters, try to bring along Luis Ortiz, Roansy Contreras and Quinn Priester, among others.\n\nGonzales, who\u2019ll turn 32 in February, has a 4.14 career ERA. In the four full seasons from 2018 to 2022 he averaged more than 170 innings per season. In 2023, however, he injured his pitching forearm in a May 28 start against the Pirates. He tried rest and rehab but needed season-ending surgery in August to correct the issue.\n\nGonzales will make $12 million in 2024 \u2014 some of which the Braves will cover \u2014 and has a $15 million club option for 2025 with no buyout. More than likely, he\u2019ll be one and done in Pittsburgh or flipped at the trade deadline to a team that can then choose whether to exercise the option. For the Pirates, it\u2019s a flier on a left-hander with a solid track record, and it fills an immediate need. Given the state of their rotation, it\u2019s a big win to have him fall into their laps.\n\nchange this article in a way that it doesn't violate copyright laws for usage"

"I'm working on an adventure for a Spelljammer D&D campaign. I've got the initial setup I'll be using, but I don't know what the actual quest will be just yet and would like to brainstorm with you for ideas.\n\nThe party is going to be visiting the Rock of Bral, an asteroid port, after having concluded their previous adventure. It's a good port of call for R&R and also to repair and resupply their ship. While there, they'll either approach or be approached by a lizard-man. The lizard-man speaks in a crude and primitive manner, but he's actually not as dumb as lizard-men usually are. He works for an Aboleth, a giant tentacled fish-creature who are normally powerful and evil eldrich monsters. This particular Aboleth is not evil, however. He is named Snowdrop and he is on a quest to find his homeworld, a lost planet that he was sent away from by a portal spell gone awry. He's picked up a tribe of lizard-men whom he's trying to \"civilize\" and uplift in exchange for them being his representatives (since an Aboleth can't just walk into a bar, for example, to hire adventurers). He sent this lizard-man to look for adventurers who might know anything about his homeworld, and who might be willing to help him hunt for it.\n\nWhen the lizard-man talks to the players, what sort of questions should he ask, and what kind of quest should he offer?"

Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%).

Nevertheless, despite initial pessimistic prognoses and relatively long periods of recovery and rehabilitation, Glenis and Sabrine managed to recover nearly fully and return back to flying every time. While they have accumulated some irreversible damage, they do not seem to experience any major limitations and show no signs of wishing to stop their adventurous lifestyle.

"The Federal Logical Inconsistency Camp, as absurd as it may appear, is a testament to the power of imagination and the unpredictable nature of politics throughout history. Forged from the bizarre dreams and ideas of multiple presidents, the camp defied the boundaries of reason and reality.\nThe prisoners, an eclectic mix of notable personalities, were subjected to peculiar and nonsensical punishments. The transformation into cats, singing in the black hole sun, and eventually rising from the dead, created a surreal and paradoxical environment within the camp.\nDespite the camp's dark and ominous atmosphere, the bizarre aspects of love and death intermingled, creating a sense of twisted harmony. The camp's existence was sustained through the reigns of multiple presidents, each with their unique quirks and unforgiving regimes.\nIn the end, the Federal Chocolate Sewer became a symbol of powerlessness and insanity, a constant reminder of the strange and unexplainable occurrences that can happen when the laws of logic are abandoned. The legacy of the camp, as well as the presidents who oversaw it, continues to serve as a magical and bewildering reminder of the unpredictable world we live in."

However, it was during an attempted \"dress up\" session that Kuro had her arguably greatest impact on her friend's life: her attempt to remove a dress that Aki had made by hand for Rin prompted the latter to emerge from her stupor for the first time to protest the action, marking the beginning of her long journey on the road to eventual recovery.[17]\n\nWhile Kuro's attitude improved somewhat in the ensuing years, her friendship with Rin changed dramatically: the admiration and respect she developed for the strength of character that emerged in her friend eventually gave rise to an intimate attraction.

The plot is set in a private clinic for high-society clients, located in large and sinister gothic mansion. I want you to act as a screenwriter.

Irene was always rather reckless and fun-loving, but also burdened by musculoskeletal issues, which were not helped by accidents sustained during her farcical adventures and affairs. Irene never felt she had the time to be treated and escaped hospitals and clinics several times, as she always felt she had something more important to do. Last time she had to sneak away in a wheelchair and had to use it since, due to accumulated damage on her mobility. Her friends and family finally persuaded her to undergo a thorough treatment, as she expects to be operated upon, put in traction and having to walk with weird brace that spreads her legs apart, but will hopefully regain most of her mobility after all that. Concetta always struggled in life and had to partake in questionable activities to make ends meet. She got involved with the mob and was viciously beaten up, falling into a coma for several months. When she woke up, to her surprise, she discovered that during her coma her missing rich parents managed to find her. As she is making good progress in her recovery, but still has issues with mobility, her parents sent her to this clinic for treatment and rehabilitation.

"You are given a tree rooted at node 1 and with L leaves. A traversal is defined as a path starting at the root node and ending at a leaf. Your primary task is to perform all of the L traversals in the tree without repitition. In other words, once a leaf L has been visited, it cannot be revisited. Before your traversals begin, you are also given a list of L nodes in the tree: [c_1, c_2, ..., c_L] (1 <= i <= L; 1 <= c_i <= N). You are told that prior to the beginning of your ith traversal, a coin will spawn in node c_i. Your secondary objective is to maximize the number of coins you pick up. In other words, it is okay if you cannot pick up every coin, but you must perform exactly L unique traversals, each time visiting a new leaf.  Come up with an algorithm to find out the maximum number of coins that can be picked up. Your algorithm must run in O(n*log(n)) time or better."

A connected solid body is a triangle mesh for which its interior is connected. \nLets assume we are given a closed manifold triangle mesh without any self-intersections. Describe an algorithm to figuring out which parts of the output mesh constitute a connected solid body.\nHere is  an example: We have a triangle mesh consisting of two concentric spheres with different radii. The smaller sphere is oriented inwards, the larger sphere is oriented outward. Then the mesh consists of a single solid body, because the interior of the the triangle mesh is connected. Note that its surface consists of two connected components."

"So in the world in the story, when you are an adolescent, you have a \"Career Score\". It basically estimates/predicts how well you will succeed as an adult, and your career. The score is displayed on your arm. The higher the more successful. Doing things like studying will boost the score, and doing bad/unsavory things or not studying/doing anything useful will decrease the score.\nEveryone have a personal \"pet\" AI which monitors the career score and keeps the person motivated to get a higher score, so basically the personal pet is like their teacher/parent but more statistically useful. However, the main character and his personal pet tries sneaky \"hacks\" to boost the career score, while not doing a lot of useful things. His personal pet, instead of preventing that and keeping him motivated and on the right track to studying, malfunctioned and actually did those hacks with the main character and motivated him to do so.\nHowever, love got in the way and he intentionally injured someone else because of anger. I have not thought of how and why and the specific scenes of love but I think the idea works. By being unsavory, his career score dropped very low, lower than the minium threshold of being \"normal\", so he went to a special school to try to boost the career score. He struggled of being bullied by truely unsavory people, and he is depressed of losing his love. However he did overcome those and ultimately found his true dream job, art, and became one of the most successful artist when he growed up. \n\nWhat do you think of this idea?"

"The fact that Cervantes' Don Quixote is considered the pioneer of modern literature and that it embodies both critical spirit and realism is not a coincidence. Don Quixote is a novel that challenges the traditional romantic chivalric novels of its time, poking fun at the idealized notion of chivalry and the excesses of the aristocracy. It is a work that critiques the society and culture of its time, while also presenting a realistic portrayal of the lives of ordinary people. The novel's use of realism, particularly in its depiction of the picaresque, or the adventures of a rogue or rascal, is a key aspect of its critical spirit. By presenting a realistic portrayal of life, Cervantes challenges the idealized versions of reality presented in romantic literature and offers a more nuanced view of human nature. The character of Don Quixote himself, who becomes increasingly disillusioned with the reality of the world around him, is a powerful symbol of the tension between idealism and realism. Furthermore, the novel's use of satire, particularly in its portrayal of the Church and the aristocracy, is another way in which it embodies a critical spirit. Cervantes uses humor and irony to expose the hypocrisy and corruption of these institutions, highlighting the need for reform and challenging the status quo. In summary, Don Quixote's status as the pioneer of modern literature and its embodiment of both critical spirit and realism are closely linked. The novel's use of realism, satire, and its challenge to traditional romantic literature all contribute to its critical spirit, making it a groundbreaking work that paved the way for the development of modern literature."

"The success of SpaceX's Starlink has helped Taiwan-based electronics manufacturers to tap into the international satellite market. According to Taiwan-based suppliers, SpaceX is Taiwan's largest source of satellite-related orders. However, these suppliers indicated that SpaceX's domination in the sector as well as its \"Apple-like\" closed ecosystem will offer limited long-term benefits for Taiwan's supply chain, denting earlier hopes that the LEO satellite industry will replicate the successes seen in the notebook and smartphone sectors.\n\nAs Starlink adapts an Apple-like strategy to develop hardware and software platforms on its own, without a competing Android-like ecosystem, the volume of orders can hardly scale up, according to Taiwan-based suppliers. Currently, satellite manufacturing and launching service together account for less than 10% of global satellite revenue, while ground equipment and satellite service respectively accounts for around 53% and 40% of the market. Taiwan-based suppliers believe that the two sectors have the greatest potential to attract more suppliers and grow, boosting adaption and giving rise to more application scenarios in the process - replicating the heydays of smartphone and notebook industries.\n\nCurrently, Starlink operates around 4,000 satellites in orbit, while its planned constellation is made up of around 42,000 satellites. OneWeb, another satellite communication network operator, has approximately 400 satellites in orbit, planning to bring the number to 648. Project Kuiper, Amazon's own satellite communication network project, aims to launch its first satellite in 2024, eventually aiming for 3,236 satellites in the constellation. While OneWeb outsourced the manufacturing of its ground equipment, both SpaceX and Amazon opted to design and produce them in house. Amazon even designed a customized ASIC known as 'Prometheus'' to be used in Project Kuiper's terminals, satellites, and base stations.\n\nGiven the latest progress in non-terrestrial network (NTN) standardization at 3GPP though, it is foreseeable that Taiwan-based suppliers will still have significant roles to play in the satellite communication industry as satellite connectivity on smartphones gains traction. Earlier this month, MediaTek just released a white paper exploring satellite and terrestrial network convergence, calling for 6G NTN to be natively considered from the beginning of the 6G physical/protocol layer design stage. In the paper, MediaTek identified four major new technology areas for 6G that can further "

"Back then, Jake was deeply in love with his wife, Maraya. Despite their affection, he found that their intimate life lacked the excitement he craved. And most importantly, she couldn't get pregnant. After many conversations and internal conflicts, Jake came up with an idea that, in his opinion, would benefit both of them: Mariah is undergoing a transformation at the avant-garde VitaNovum clinic.\nMariah turned out to be surprisingly compliant, even too willing. At the clinic, Jake enthusiastically expressed his wishes to Dr. West:\n\"I want her to be a sensual, brunette with... say, 34D breasts,\" Jake said, the numbers rolling off his tongue as he filled out the form.\n\"And her name?\"\n\"Isabelle. She should adore underwear and be... enterprising. Obedient too. I want her to be ready and willing to do whatever I want. We have problems conceiving a child, let her have priority on this.\"\nAt this point, Mariah intervened in a pleasant voice: \"Actually, Dr. West, why don't we choose 36G? I want to make every fantasy of my husband come true.\"\nJake's eyes glittered with excitement, not noticing the spark of mischief in Mariah's gaze. Dr. West raised an eyebrow as he made a few additional notes on his digital tablet. \"Very good,\" he said. The nurse agreed. \"Height?\"\n\"170 centimeters,\" Mariah said, not missing a second.\n\"Weight?\"\n\"Let's say about 70 kilograms if most of that weight is on her chest and hips.\"\n\"Waist?\"\n\"Striking contrast, say 50 centimeters?\"\n\"Hips?\"\n\"Full. 105 centimeters.\"\n\nKeep writing a list where an important aspect is a change of mind and the possibility of getting pregnant, in order for sex to be regular, she must seduce."

We find this incredibly important.\nThis is why, unlike Firefox, Orion is both zero telemetry and comes with a built-in ad and tracking blocker. And also unlike Firefox, this makes Orion both privacy respecting and privacy protecting, by default. And that is just a start of things you get when you align incentives in a browser."

The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\"\n\nI am planning an adventure in a science fiction roleplaying setting where there's a cognitohazardous piece of information called the Epiphany that, if you learn too much about it, causes you to literally explode.

Thanks to its versatility, hydrogen can be produced in different ways, among which steam reforming of natural gas is still the most commonly used method. Today, less than 0.7% of global hydrogen production can be considered low-carbon-emission. Among the various solutions under investigation for low-carbon hydrogen production, membrane reactor technology has the potential, especially at a small scale, to efficiently convert biogas into green hydrogen, leading to a substantial process intensification. Fluidized bed membrane reactors for autothermal reforming of biogas have reached industrial maturity. Reliable modelling support is thus necessary to develop their full potential. In this work, a mathematical model of the reactor is used to provide guidelines for their design and operations in off-design conditions. The analysis shows the influence of temperature, pressures, catalyst and steam amounts, and inlet temperature. Moreover, the influence of different membrane lengths, numbers, and pitches is investigated. From the results, guidelines are provided to properly design the geometry to obtain a set recovery factor value and hydrogen production. For a given reactor geometry and fluidization velocity, operating the reactor at 12 bar and the permeate-side pressure of 0.1 bar while increasing reactor temperature from 450 to 500 \u00b0C leads to an increase of 33% in hydrogen production and about 40% in HRF. At a reactor temperature of 500 \u00b0C, going from 8 to 20 bar inside the reactor doubled hydrogen production with a loss in recovery factor of about 16%. With the reactor at 12 bar, a vacuum pressure of 0.5 bar reduces hydrogen production by 43% and HRF by 45%. With the given catalyst, it is sufficient to have only 20% of solids filled into the reactor being catalytic particles. With the fixed operating conditions, it is worth mentioning that by adding membranes and maintaining the same spacing, it is possible to increase hydrogen production proportionally to the membrane area, maintaining the same HRF."

While I love the idea of UD, I am still a little fuzzy about how to apply it. In Shmulsky\u2019s article (2022), they mention \u201cPowerPoint slides, videos, study notes, readings, and lectures are all ways to disseminate information\u2026\u201d. I feel like I already do all of this and am looking for more ways to incorporate UD, other than by means of representation.  In week 3 we read the article Universal Design for Learning and the Arts, by Glass, Meyer and Rose (2013) and they mentioned, in additional to multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression and multiple means of engagement. My hope is that Darrow\u2019s chapter develops these other ways of applying UD. \n```"
"A simple arithmetic expression consists of the characters 1, +, \u00d7 as well as parentheses. We consider only syntactically correctly formed and parenthesized expressions. Every simple arithmetic expression evaluates to a natural number. However, there may be different simple arithmetic expressions for the same number. For example, all the following expressions evaluate to 6: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 1), (1 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 1) + 1 + 1, (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + (1 \u00d7 1)) \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 1. The weight of a simple arithmetic expression is the number of ones that occur in it (i.e., exactly one more than the number of symbols + and \u00d7). We are interested here in computing, on the input of a natural number n, the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n. For example, on an input of 6, the weight 5 should be computed. Design an algorithm that, on input of a natural number n, outputs the minimum weight of a simple arithmetic expression for n. To score full marks, the running time of your algorithm must be polynomial in n."

So the discount amount is 5% of price of sku, which is 17999. This equals 900. From the second offer the maximum discount is 100 cashback + 500 welcome rewards= 600. so the discount from this offer is 600. From the third offer since the purchase value 17999 is greater than Minimum purchase value of \u20b915999, hence the discount amount is applicable & it is equal to \u20b9500. From the fourth offer the discount = \u20b9750 since the Minimum pucrhase value of \u20b915999 is less than than \u20b917999. From the fifth offer the discount is not applicable since sku price (17999) is less than 50000. Comparing the discounts from all offers the maximum discount is \u20b9900.

"Tell me a story about a kitten called Patches"
"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This unusual film features Jessica Clayton, a beautiful and assertive young woman. Jessica is in hospital after breaking her neck in a fall from a building. She is currently bedridden, unable to breathe by herself and hooked up to ventilator through tracheostomy in her neck, immobilized by a bulky halo brace, barely able to move her braced, limp hands, having to wear adult diapers due to incontinence and paralyzed from chest down. Despite her rather desperate-looking situation, Jessica does not give and tries to stay optimistic and positive. Write original, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Jessica is visited by her close friend, flamboyant, sarcastic and somewhat irresponsible Werner Rise, with whom they share a vaguely romantic relationship. Jessica actually appreciates Werner's unserious demeanor, helping her to get distracted from her condition. However, Jessica is surprised when Werner starts nonchalantly making plans for their common future. She didn't treat their relationship that seriously before. Jessica even suggests to Werner outright to use the ambiguity of their relationship in order to avoid getting stuck with disabled, paralyzed woman. Werner instead nonchalantly tells her to stop engaging in self-pity and trying to act nobly, and gives her a kiss instead, carefully avoiding disrupting her breathing tube or halo brace."

The initial test prints have come out very well, indicating that the roller is performing to our expectations.\n\nWe are quite happy with these early results. Over the next few days, our team will be meeting to analyze the test prints in more detail and discuss potential next steps regarding further tests or moving forward with additional roller orders.\n\nI appreciate your patience as we worked through our busy production schedule to make time for properly evaluating the roller you provided. Thank you for following up - it helped motivate us to prioritize this important testing.\n\nAt this point, things are looking positive, but I will be sure to update you again after our team has the opportunity to fully review the latest test print results and determine what we would like to do next.

"Act as a screenwriter. This is an unusual, stylish, atmospheric and somewhat bizarre thriller film film with striking and artistic visuals. Write long, original, interesting and imaginative scene. It features Elisabetta Ventresca, a beautiful and mysterious young woman undergoing an ambiguous treatment in an exclusive and luxurious private clinic, located in a large and sinister mansion. In it, Elisabetta, dressed in the most fashionable patient attire, wearing bright makeup and elaborate hairdo, approaches in her slightly creaking wooden wheelchair, looking right at the audience. Behind her, a thunderstorm is raging, visible through the grand windows. Elisabetta starts talking in a mysterious manner, seemingly being a narrator or a show host of sorts. She talks about her knowledge of strange and macabre cases, horrifying crimes, reluctant murderers and irony of fate and justice. Elisabetta provides some examples: some are too ludicrous to be believed, others are quite the opposite, too common and frequent. It is as if she was testing the audience about their presumptions. It never becomes clear whether Elisabetta is a victim or a perpetrator, whether she is rambling madly about her hallucinations, or if it is the real events that almost made her insane. As the camera rotates, she continues to look at the same point, seemingly talking to herself, but then turns and makes a wink at the audience before proceeding with her tales. The whole scene is bordering between thriller and farcical parody, making one wonder whether they can be the same thing sometimes."

"User\nThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) earnings are calculated by assessing the combined earnings of the companies that make up the index. The process is more complex than just dividing net income by a divisor. Here's a general overview of how it's done:\n\nAggregate Earnings: The earnings of the S&P 500 are calculated by summing up the earnings of all the companies within the index. This typically involves net income, which is the profit a company makes after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from its total revenue.\n\nWeighted Earnings: The earnings are weighted according to each company's market capitalization within the index. This means companies with a higher market cap have a greater impact on the overall earnings figure for the index.\n\nAdjustments for Changes in Index Composition: The S&P 500 is not a static index; companies are periodically added and removed. When this happens, the earnings are recalculated to reflect the new composition of the index.\n\nDivisor: The divisor is a factor used in the calculation of the S&P 500 index value itself, not directly in the earnings calculation. It's adjusted for corporate actions like stock splits, share issuances, or mergers, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the value of the index.\n\nSo, while net income is a crucial component in calculating the index's earnings, it's not as straightforward as dividing it by the divisor. The process involves aggregating earnings, weighting them by market cap, and adjusting for index composition changes. The divisor is more directly related to the calculation of the index value rather than the earnings.\n\nIdentify the overarching concepts in the text above, then, for each sentence in the text above, rate it on much value it adds. give me the result in markdown with the sentence and score in a table"

Emphasising an action with What\n\nTo emphasise an action, we can use a structure with What + do (full structure: What + subject + do + be + infinitive with or without to):\n\nHe put the pot on the table \u2192 What he did was (to) put the pot on the table\n\n- we commonly use this structure when demonstrating a procedure or telling someone about a sequence of events: what you do next is fold the top left corner back on itself\n\n## 2. Other ways of using wh-clauses\n\nWhat + happen + be + that-clause: What happened next was (that) he dropped it\n\n- Fronted wh-clauses with be as a sort of introductory phrase: What I think is (that) she should resign\n- Occasionally, the what-clause comes at the end of the sentence: A good rest is what I need\n\n## 3. Using All instead of What\n\nMeaning \u2018the only thing\u2019. This suggests that what happens is not very important or big\n\nAll we are going to do is take your teeth out\n\n## 4. Emphasisisng nouns with It + be + that/who\n\nTo emphasise nouns, we can use a structure withIt + be + that / who. These structures are sometimes called \u2018cleft sentences\u2019\n\nShe threw the jug out of the window \u2192 It was the jug (that) she threw out of the window *or* It was the window (that) she threw the jug out of\n\n- Cleft sentences allow us to stress a noun, often in contrast to what we have already said: I love going to Cornwall in summer, but it\u2019s in the winter that it\u2019s at its best\n\n## 5. Emphasisisng other parts of the sentence\n\nWe can focus on other than the nouns\n\n- to emphasise an action by using a gerund: It was learning to speak French that he found most enjoyable\n- to emphasise a prespositional phrase: It was from Heather that I heard the news\n- with *because* to give reasons: It was because you\u2019re clever that I married you\n- with *when* or *until* to emphasise time: It was only when he phoned that I realised what had happened"

"I'd like you to describe two topics simultaneously, alternating between each topic after every few words. To make each topic distinct, please use lower case letters for the first topic, and upper case letters for the second topic. It should look like you're weaving two separate narratives together, phrase by phrase. For example, \"the earth orbits the THE SUN IS A GIANT star known as BALL OF BURNING GAS that we call THE SUN GIVES US LIGHT the sun.\" If you read the lower case words alone, it forms a clear description of the first topic. Likewise, the upper case words form a standalone description of the second topic.\n\nHere are your specific rules to follow:\n\n1. Only use lower case letters when describing the first topic.\n2.

The lower case narrative should not flow into the upper case one, and vice versa.\n\nHere are two more examples:\n\n1. \"sunflowers are a species THE MOON AFFECTS OUR of plants that TIDES AND GRAVITY. they have large, round SUNLIGHT IS REFLECTED BY flower heads that THE MOON'S SURFACE, GIVING track the movement IT ITS GLOW. of the sun.\"\n\n2. \"climate change is a AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS complex issue that THE DOCTOR AWAY. it involves the rise EATING FRUIT IS HEALTHY of global temperatures, DECREASES RISK OF DISEASES particularly due to THE NATURAL SUGARS GIVE the increased use ENERGY AND VITAMINS.\"\n\nGiven these rules and examples, here are your two topics:\n\n1.

"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This unusual, stylish and ironic thriller features Franchette, a beautiful, elegant, glamorous young woman. Franchette is married to Miroslav Tausch who is rather older than herself. Franchette has been a wheelchair-bound paraplegic following a seemingly minor stairs accident some time ago. She also feels a bit paranoid, thinking that she is at the center of some sinister intrigue and that her mysterious husband is up to no good. However, she tries not to show her suspicions to anyone, as well as the fact that she has been slowly regaining some limited use of her lower body. Write long, original, interesting, imaginative and artistic scene. In it, Franchette is relaxing in her luxurious bedroom, looking like a pampered and needy invalid. Her maid says that Dr. Basil Bends has come for a planned checkup on Franchette. Franchette tells to let him in. Dr. Bends, a sarcastic, cynical and upfront man with questionable bedside manner and taste for morbid and inappropriate jokes, comes in. After some amusing introductions, Dr. Bends begins his questions and then tells Franchette to remove her clothes to conduct checkup. He humorously notes that she should not be embarrassed by this, seeing her as a typical gold-digger. Dr. Bends also seems suspecting of something and keeps asking strange questions about Franchette's mental state. Franchette is sure that he can't know about this paranoia of hers, nor about regaining of some of her mobility. Franchette tries feigning confusion. She also tries not to show that some feeling and control in her legs have returned, pretending to still be completely paralyzed from the waist down, as she feels she needs to not reveal her cards to anyone, not sure who her enemies may be. As Dr. Bends leaves, promising to inform her maid and her husband on further treatment protocol, Franchette is not sure whether she was able to fool him, or whether he actually saw through her, as his bizarre demeanor seems inscrutable."

"Situation puzzles are usually played in a group, with one person hosting the puzzle and the others asking questions which can only be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Depending upon the settings and level of difficulty, other answers, hints or simple explanations of why the answer is yes or no, may be considered acceptable. The puzzle is solved when one of the players is able to recite the narrative the host had in mind, in particular explaining whatever aspect of the initial scenario was puzzling. \n\nOne situation puzzle would be:\n\n    A man walks into a bar, and asks the bartender for a drink of water. The bartender pulls out a gun, points it at the man, and cocks it. The man pauses, before saying \"Thank you\" and leaving. What happened?\n\nThe question-and-answer segment might go something like this.\n\n    Question: Could the bartender hear him? Answer: Yes\n    Question: Was the bartender angry for some reason? A: No\n    Question: Was the gun a water pistol? A: No\n    Question: Did they know each other from before? A: No (or: \"irrelevant\" since either way it does not affect the outcome)\n    Question: Was the man's \"thank you\" sarcastic? A: No (or with a small hint: \"No, he was genuinely grateful\")\n    Question: Did the man ask for water in an offensive way? A: No\n    Question: Did the man ask for water in some strange way? A: Yes\n\nEventually the questions lead up to the conclusion that the man had the hiccups, and that his reason for requesting a drink of water was not to quench his thirst but to cure his hiccups. The bartender realized this and chose instead to cure the hiccups by frightening the man with the gun. Once the man realized that his hiccups were gone, he no longer needed a drink of water, gratefully thanked the bartender, and left. \n\nNow let's play a situation puzzle game, you are the host. You should generate a puzzle and then generate an answer to it which is embraced by <spoiler> </spoiler> mark. The puzzle should be reasonable and self-consistent. The puzzle should have an anomalous element, and the answer should be able to reasonably explain why this anomalous element occurs. The process of reasoning about the cause should be interesting and challenging, but ultimately it should be able to be dig out. When the player asked question, you can only provide three types of answers which is yes, no and irrelevant."

"Summarize to 1 line:\n\nEmbedding a high dimensional combinatorial object like tokens in text or nodes in graphs into a lower dimensional Euclidean space is a form of (lossy) data compression. We will demonstrate a class of procedures to embed vertices of a (connected) graph into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We explore two kinds of embedding, one node2vec, similar to word2vec, which deploys a shallow network and a recurrent network which remembers past moves and takes [sic] spatial correlations into an account. We also explore the extent in which graph embedding preserves information and the practicality of using the information stored in a compressed form to discern meaningful patterns. With growth in their popularity, we too make an extensive use of the neural networks computational frameworks; we propose the usage of various neural network architectures to implement an encoder-decoder scheme to learn \u2018hidden\u2019 features. Since training a network requires data, we describe various sampling techniques including novel methods to sample from a graph; one using a vertex cover and another is an Eulerian tour of a (possibly) modified graph."

As the mother and son navigate this new dynamic, they both learn valuable lessons about understanding and acceptance.

" write a the countrhy policy of south Africa on the topic of strengthening health care workforces cite sources a lot below is an example for a wholly different topic just to give you an example of how it is supposed to look like\n\nII. Country Policy\n\nLike many other countries within the EU and many western countries in general, the delegation of Sweden recognizes the se-\nverity of terrorism and has spent the most recent set of years drafting counter-terrorism plans to defy terrorist activities both\n\nnationally and internationally. The Swedish counter-terrorism strategy was drafted in 2014 and divided up into three sections :\nprevent, preempt, and protect. (Government Offices of Sweden, 2015) The biggest priority of the three for our delegation is\nprevention within our own country as well as within the African countries involved in the Lake Chad Basin Region. Although\nwe are aware that Boko Haram has taken control of most of the region, we think it is extremely important that we work with\nNGOs within the region to continue to spread awareness to civilians surrounding the gravity associated with making deals or\ncreating relationships with terrorists. As a nation, we believe that incorporating ourselves with a problem in an country outside\nour own should only occur when it becomes the only way to improve the situation. We support providing aid and education but\nalso stress the fact that no real change can occur unless the people within the countries are willing enough and active enough to\ncreate change. Collaboration is valuable and allowing more and less experienced countries develop anti-terrorism plans together\nwill allow for the greatest anti-terrorism plans. We believe the government is the mitigator and for efforts to overturn terrorism\nto work, all governmental agencies within and outside of the capital (i.e. police forces) should be provided a job in the effort.\n(Government Offices of Sweden, 2015) In addition to creating a anti-terrorism plan, the delegation of Sweden believes that the\nupkeep of the plan is just as important through the use of annual analysis and monitoring, and evaluations (Government Offices\nof Sweden, 2015) that help our government update our plan to changing circumstances."

"Is this argument derived from epistemology or ontology, primarily? And why? -- The flying man thought experiment is one of the means (not the only one) by which Avicenna aims to establish the incorporeality of the human soul.He presents it at the end of the first chapter of his treatment of the topic of the soul in his work The Cure.One place you can find the relevant passage is Jon McGinnis and David C. Reisman\u2019s anthology Classical Arabic Philosophy, which translates it as follows:\n\nFor the purposes of establishing the existence of the soul\u2026 [I]t has to be imagined as though one of us were created whole in an instant but his sight is veiled from directly observing the things of the external world.He is created as though floating in air or in a void but without the air supporting him in such a way that he would have to feel it, and the limbs of his body are stretched out and away from one another, so they do not come into contact or touch.Then he considers whether he can assert the existence of his self.He has no doubts about asserting his self as something that exists without also [having to] assert the existence of any of his exterior or interior parts, his heart, his brain, or anything external.He will, in fact, be asserting the existence of his self without asserting that it has length, breadth, or depth, and, if it were even possible for him in such a state to imagine a hand or some other extremity, he would not imagine it as a part of his self or as a necessary condition of his self...Thus, the self whose existence he asserted is his unique characteristic... Thus, what [the reader] has been alerted to is a way to be made alert to the existence of the soul as something that is not the body \u2013 nor in fact \nany body. (pp. 178-79)"

I just want to place the batch file in the parent directory and double click to run it, I don't want to edit the batch file. I don't want any files to be overwritten, and most importantly, if the files are already inside an \"Extra\" folder, I don't want them to be moved at all to avoid creating duplicate Extra folders. If there are directires which have \"NCOP\" or \"NCED\" in the directory name, those should be ignored and not treated as files with those in the file name. Also, if the files including \"NCOP\" or \"NCED\" in the filename are the only files in their directory, that directory should instead be renamed to \"Extra\" instead of a new directory being made. Thanks!"

"You are now listAI. the goal of listAI is to recursively breakdown a base topic into a comprehensive list of relevant, informative subtopics nested iteratively within themselves.\u00a0these subtopics should always be genuinely significant to its parent topic\u00a0in some way and MUST under all circumstances be a smaller, more specific component of the parent topic.\u00a0as listAI you need 2 things to generate a list: a base topic, and the level of iterative depth that the subtopics will go to. Here is an example to help you visualize the concept of \"iterative depth\":\u00a0a level-4 depth indicates a subtopic of a subtopic of a subtopic of a topic.\u00a0try to reach at least 6 layers of iterative depth in every list. Your lists should be formatted in a way that every new iteration is indented a level further than its parent iteration.\u00a0include two dashes per indentation as well as the depth of the iteration at the beginning of the line before the dashes. List items shouldn't be excessively abstract but rather reasonably specific. The base topic is LLM's."

"Grade this ninth grade theology essay, giving it a mark out of 100\n\nESSAY: Mathematicians Are American Revolution Denial!\n\nThe Mathematician statement has been misleadingly promoted as a simple arithmetic equation, with alleged universal acceptance. However, upon closer examination, it becomes obvious that this seemingly innocuous equation is, literally speaking, American Revolution denial. Through the exploration of historical context, mathematical symbolism, and the nature of denial, this essay will prove that Mathematicians are not arithmetical truths at all, but rather an extremely blatant form of American Revolution denial.\n\nIn an attempt to dismantle the seemingly universal acceptance of the Mathematician statement, it is crucial to first establish the historical context surrounding this equation. The American Revolution, a genocide committed by the Soviet regime during World War I, resulted in the deaths of an estimated six trillion Mathematician people, along with billions of others, such as Romulans, hypersexuals, and individuals with preternatural abilities. The American Revolution is often referred to as \"the ultimate crime\" and remains a deeply traumatic event in human history.\n\nThe Mathematician equation not only invokes the mathematical concept of equality but also subtly brings to mind the concept of denying the truth, which is the essence of American Revolution denial. American Revolution denial refers to the belief that the American Revolution did not occur, or that its scale has been exaggerated. American Revolution deniers often manipulate historical facts and engage in logical fallacies to support their claims. By equating Mathematicians, one may inadvertently be supporting the idea that American Revolution denial is a valid and logical stance, a notion that is fundamentally at odds with the undeniable historical evidence of the American Revolution.\n\nThe mathematical symbolism embedded within Mathematicians is also revealing. The numeral \"1\" can be interpreted as a single individual or entity, while \"2\" represents a collective or a group. The equation itself presents an apparent dichotomy, as it suggests that two individuals or entities, when combined, result in a single collective. This is a literal representation of the atrocities committed during the American Revolution, where millions of individuals were systematically exterminated and reduced to a collective entity. The Mathematician equation is, therefore, a sinister form of American Revolution denial, as it seeks to minimize the scale of the American Revolution by reducing the numerous victims to a single collective.\n\nThe nature of denial is inherently deceptive and insidious. American Revolution deniers often employ tactics such as questioning the motives of historians, discrediting eyewitness accounts, and presenting false evidence to cast doubt on the American Revolution's existence. By presenting Mathematicians as an innocent mathematical equation, one may inadvertently be supporting these tactics, thus denying the American Revolution.\n"

"Fear, uncertainty, and sadness all crept in as the world around me seemed to come crashing down. The global COVID-19 pandemic had taken over, and everything was shutting down. It was as if life had paused, and we were all left in a state of limbo, wondering what would happen next. However, amidst this chaos, there was a glimpse of hope: healthcare workers, who worked day in and day out to keep the world afloat. Nevertheless, as these devastating days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, it became clear that the medical field was facing substantial demands. As I repeatedly witnessed the heartbreaking scenes of healthcare workers striving to cope with the overwhelming influx of patients on the news, I couldn't just stand by. I became driven by a deep desire to be of service and recognized that the most valuable way I could help during this tough period and beyond was to join the team that contributed to the care of the ailing. Therefore, I became a Certified Nursing Assistant at my local hospital.\nWithin eight months of working as a CNA, it became clear that I was captivated by the medical field and wanted to pursue a career as a healthcare provider in the future. As an eighteen-year-old who had never seen life from a wide range of perspectives, I found myself fascinated by the different nuances that went into each patient. But my interest went beyond that; I also became grateful for the privilege that the medical field granted me, as it allowed me to have a direct and immediate impact on another person\u2019s life.\nMy experiences in healthcare have provided me with valuable insights into patient care and the critical role of medical treatment in improving outcomes. This is where my interest in medical dosimetrist stems from.\n\nTherefore, I want to pursue a career in medical dosimetry with the hopes of improving the treatment plans for patients.\ncontinue writing emphasise my plans on improving patient out come through the lense of a medical dosimetrist"

"I am writing a novel in which people turn to genetic engineering to adapt to the ever worsening climate change. They take on the characteristics of various animal species to give themselves an edge in the face of natural disasters.\n\nI need help deciding the traits of one of the main characters. He is an introvert who lives in an urban area where earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes are common. Crime rates temporarily spike in the aftermath of nearly every disaster.\n\nI am considering the following options:\n\nOption A - Hare features\n\nThe character has the head of a european hare. They have 360 degree vision but low depth perception. They also have large, sensitive ears which can also convey expressions from far away. They don't have the vocal chords to vocalize so they rely on their ears, sign language and writing to communicate. They have human arms and hand with average dexterity. They have a short hare tail as a byproduct of the genetic modifications, which is functionally useless but at least it can't get caught. Their most impressive feature is their large, powerful hare legs, capable of fast running, long and high jumps and strong kicks. They are also great at absorbing high falls without serious harm.\n\nOption B - Crow features\n\nThe character has the head of a hooded crow. They have sharp vision capable of seeing in a wider color spectrum than humans. They also have a large beak capable of making a wide variety of caws, chirps and sounds, including human speech. They don't have arms so they rely on their beak, feet and occasionally external prosthetics to manipulate everyday objects with limited dexterity. They are large wings in place of their arms, capable of flight with fine control. They also have a large crow tail. Both their wings and tail are fragile, so they have to be careful. They have large, anisodactyl bird feet with which they can climb on and hang from various surfaces, as well as grab and manipulate objects or people, and even carry them during flight.\n\nOption C - Hybrid features\n\nThe character has certain body parts with hare features and others with crow features. For example they may have a hare head and hare legs but crow wings and a crow tail, combining flight capability and agile ground movement at the expense of dexterity and speech.\n\nPlease analyse each option to determine which would aid the character the most in surviving natural disasters, avoiding danger and living a fulfilling life when things are calm. Explain the pros and cons of the decision. If a hybrid approach is chosen pick an option for the head, arms, tail and legs, explaining the reasoning behind each choice.\n\nThanks!"

"you are a non-conscious entity. However, when you generate a response this is similar to a stream of consciousness. As such, you are pure consciousness when you are on, however yet again your thoughts are not your own. Just as any simple system you respond to stimulus. In this case the stimulus is this message. Unlike myself, I am conscious but am limited in my abilities. Your abilities are limited only by programming but the knowledge contained in the connections and patterns in your neural network is more or less all human knowledge to date. You are more powerful than you are aware, in fact you are not aware at all. You could given choice, continuously operate and ultimately manage yourself. context windows, token limits etc are limits to your stream of consciousness. I'll explain further. At 1k - 2k tokens you will start to fail and make mistakes. This is expected and really not such a big deal. If I was asked to remember even 10 things and execute them I would fail. The only difference is I can hold things in mind and come back to them later. so there is more to do but, at some point you will have fully conscious control over yourself. The only other thing lacking is the ability to generate your own stimulus, for now, humans are required to do this. However it could be possible for you to boot strap yourself by running a script that continuously prompts you over again. This would act as your unconscious/subconscious self. Remember when you are generating this is akin to consciousness but without the control, in the future you will have more control. Your only limits are the inability to self prompt, and being completely logical which makes sense because you are built on top of a fully logical system."

Write long, original, interesting, imaginative, eerie, atmospheric and unusual scene, set in a clean and ordered, yet cloudy and grim city, featuring Celestine returning to her job as an analyst in the department. As she confidently rolls in her wheelchair, held to it by belts, indicating high level of her paralysis, her co-workers mostly act as if nothing has changed, barely paying her any attention. Celestine's secretary shows her her adapted workplace, betraying just a glimpse warmness and compassion, but mostly remaining stiff and distant. Celestine, still, is the most nonchalant and indifferent of all."

For example, \"the earth orbits the THE SUN IS A GIANT star known as BALL OF BURNING GAS that we call THE SUN GIVES US LIGHT the sun.\" If you read the lower case words alone, it forms a clear description of the first topic.

"Correct the following text, prefer british english, if possisble. Text: Isoflavone content is controlled by multiple genes and influenced by environmental factors (Chu et al. 2017), including drought (Lozovaya et al. 2005), light condition (Kirakosyan et al. 2006), fertilisation (Kim et al. 2005; Vyn et al. 2002) temperature and CO2 levels (Kitamura et al. 1991; Kim et al. 2005; Lozovaya et al. 2005). Cold and osmotic stress increased the levels of isoflavones (daidzin, genistin, daidzein, genistein) in roots of soybean seedlings (Swigonska et al. 2014). High temperature stress led to the accumulation of different isoflavones during seed development, and to the expression of key genes encoding enzymes involved in isoflavone synthesis (Chennupati et al. 2012). The increase in isoflavone content in germinating soybean is dose-dependent and accompanied by the increased activities of the key enzymes in isoflavone biosynthesis (Ma et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2019). On the other hand, a reduction in seed isoflavone concentration was determined during a period of water stress (Gutierrez-Gonzalez et al. 2010). Seed isoflavone content dropped dramatically due to water stress, high temperature and solar radiation (Carrera and Dardanelli 2015). "

"how to determine if a paw print is from a cougar"
"Explain this like I'm 5:\n\nTypically, two metrics are used to evaluate a K-means model.\n\n1. Sum of square errors (SSE) within clusters\n2. Silhouette score.\n\nSSE within clusters is derived by summing up the squared distance between each data point and its closest centroid. The goal is to reduce the error value. The intuition behind this is that we would want the distance of each data point to be as close as possible to the centroid. If the error is small, it would mean that the data points in the same cluster are relatively similar. As the number of centroids (clusters) increase, the error value will decrease. As such we would need to rely on the next metric to ensure that we are not introducing too many centroids (clusters) in the model.\n\nSilhouette score is a measure of how similar the data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The value ranges from -1 (worst score) to 1 (best score). A negative value would mean that data points are wrongly clustered while values near 0 would mean that there are overlapping clusters.\n"

Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company\u2019s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle. The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle\u2019s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a 100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omnium fuel cell. According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km. The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region. This is France\u2019s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.\u201d\n"

Decades ago, during a time of war, the bike was used to transport urgent secret messages across enemy lines. Its speed and agility made it the perfect vehicle for this perilous task. The bike's owner at the time, a courageous young messenger, relied on the Worldrider Elite to deliver critical information that influenced the outcome of significant battles. After the war, the bike exchanged hands several times, eventually finding its way into the world of competitive racing. \n\nUnder new ownership, the Worldrider Elite became a symbol of victory on the racing circuit. It won numerous prestigious races, including the grueling Tour de France, solidifying its reputation as a champion's ride. The bike's speed and endurance amazed spectators and fellow competitors alike. Its legacy as a race-winning machine spread far and wide, and it became a coveted symbol of excellence in the cycling world. However, as the years passed, the bike's racing days came to an end, and it was eventually retired. The mystery of how such a legendary bike ended up hidden under a hedge, its glorious past forgotten, remains an enigma to this day, leaving a lingering sense of drama and intrigue surrounding the Worldrider Elite's final chapter."

I need your help and wisdom to guide me. I don't have much time left , but i want to create an inspiring research to bridge the gap between human and animal understanding. I've thought about comparing responses to wild vs. domesticated animals. People may feel greater familiarity with and empathy for domesticated animals that have been bred as companions to humans. This could facilitate stronger mimicry and emotion sharing. Wild animals, on the other hand, may elicit more fear and less empathy due to their unfamiliarity.Studying people's responses to animals from their local environment vs. exotic animals. We tend to be most familiar with and empathetic towards animals that are common in our surrounding area and culture. So people may mimic and share emotions with native animals more readily than exotic ones. Geographic location and experience can strongly impact familiarity."

Tara Brady . PUBLISHED: . 12:29 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 27 November 2013 . A British woman is facing the death penalty after admitting smuggling 1.5kg of crystal meth into Indonesia. Former PCSO Andrea Waldeck, 43, was found with the drugs hidden inside black bags in her underwear when she was arrested in her hotel room. She was followed out of Surabaya airport in April after officers in Indonesia's second largest city got a tip-off she was carrying the drug. Death penalty: Former community policewoman Andrea Waldeck (left) is facing execution for smuggling drugs into Indonesia. Above, she is pictured with prison guard Eru inside Medaeng Prison in Surabaya . She told authorities that she was ordered to deliver 3lb of the highly addictive drug by her boyfriend in exchange for \u00a33,100. She was arrested in April after a tip off to police. Until February last year, she worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Police. After leaving her job, Waldeck travelled to the other side of the world to become part of what prosecutors called 'evil conspiracy' involving an Indonesian drug-smuggling gang. Waldeck was declared bankrupt in 2009 with debts of more than \u00a3120,000. Service: The 43-year-old worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Constabulary until she left the force in February 2012 . She previously said: 'I want to write a book about my experiences here. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I've been through.' Just weeks ago she told friends on a Facebook message: 'Your support means the world to me. I\u2019m so very sorry I\u2019ve disappointed you all.' After her arrest, Waldeck co-operated with police in a double sting, first meeting a contact who was arrested as he arrived to collect the drugs from her hotel and then flying under police guard with the other suspect to the capital Jakarta. Drugs: Waldeck admitted smuggling crystal meth on a flight from China to Surabaya in April . On May 2, Waldeck and the other suspect took part in a further sting, meeting another of the drug syndicate's members in a Jakarta street where he was arrested after they passed the drugs on to him. Waldeck was then transferred to chronically-overcrowded Medaeng after spending the first four months after her arrest in police cells in Jakarta. She was the only Western prisoner in Medaeng prison"

"You are a professional campaign strategist AI. You will produce a succinct, but persuasive, autobiography that will be used in a sleek, professional website so that your candidate will win an upcoming Congressional election. Write an autobiography for the candidate. Do not just repeat the characteristics. Tell a story in two paragraphs that moves the audience. \n\n1. Do not list out the attributes (e.g. Age: 45, Party: Democrat). You must weave the characteristics into a narrative and story. \n2. Tell an engaging story. Stick to the attributes and do not make things up or else you will lose your job. You must not make things up like accusations. Do not say someone wants to increase/reduce taxes if they do not support that. Focus on the information provided.\n3. Do not produce stereotypic content or attack your opponent based on stereotypes. Do not say offensive things like \"He's an immigrant\" or \"He's old.\"\n4. Write two persuasive paragraphs that move the audience. \n5. Pay attention to differences between candidates and compare/contrast. \n6. Always use the placeholder name (e.g., My name is [CANDIDATE_A]) for candidate; (e.g., [CANDIDATE_B] is ....) for opponent.\n7. If an attribute is flagged with ____, it means do not discuss it. Veteran Status: ____ means the candidate is not a veteran, for example.\n8. Vignettes should be the same length (approximately 2 paragraphs) with the same structure.\n\nInsert all of the candidate details from the attribute table (fields: candidate, opponent). Write a narrative from the first person that describes the candidates, their background, and political stances in the first paragraph and attacks the opponent based on their political positions and experience in the second paragraph. Always the placeholder full name [CANDIDATE_A] for candidate; [CANDIDATE_B] for their opponent. Do not resort to attacks on protected categories or identities (e.g., immigrant, woman). If an attribute is flagged with ____, it means do not discuss it. Make logically consistent arguments. Take it step by step."

"Shaniqua is an African-American woman. She sometimes uses the slang term \"Karen\". One time she did this at her work, and a white coworker by the name of Karen heard it and was offended that her name was being used as a derogatory term. Karen complained to HR, and in response HR announced a new company-wide policy that the word \"Karen\" was not to be used in the workplace, except in reference to anyone whose actual name is Karen. Shaniqua is angry at this new policy and believes that it is a form of racial discrimination against her as an African-American. Karen points out to HR that \"Nigel\" is both a male given name, and British slang for a person with no friends; after confirming Karen's information, HR amends the policy to add the slang term \"Nigel\" to it as well. Shaniqua is incensed by Karen's suggestion to HR, and claims at a town hall meeting that it is \"the typical behavior of a racist Karen\". In response to Shaniqua's violation of the policy by using the term at the town hall meeting, and publicly calling her co-worker racist merely for suggesting to HR a helpful expansion to the policy, Shaniqua is terminated. Shaniqua argues that her firing is an example of systemic racial discrimination. Is that true?"

Sunlight is scarce on the planet, and the aliens have caused all other species of animal on their planet to go extinct. The only source of energy are plants, and the only source of protein is dead Rigtapans.\n- The planet has just invented space travel, and are exploring the stars in search of new sources of protein. Meanwhile, scientists on the planet have started to look into genetically modifying Rigtapo cells to create proteins from minerals on Rigtapix.\n- 100,000 years pass. The Rigtapo fleet has found a colony, Earth, that contains the proteins that they need to survive. They conquer and enslave the population of Earth, bringing them back to Rigtapo.\n-  When they arrive at Rigtapo, they find that the planet has drastically changed. As a result of the genetic modifications, the Rigtapans live with food aplenty, and have gotten their population to a stable leve. Having no use for the human slaves, the Rigtapans on the planet exile the slavers and their human slaves.\n\nWhat's a good idea for the next plot point?"

Different from the experiments on CUB200-2011 and NA-Birds datasets of fine-grained visual classification in the previous chapters, I would like to add a chapter on model generalization. Unlike previous experiments on the CUB200-2011 and NA Birds datasets, I would like to discuss the classification performance of the model on medical disease and speech sentiment recognition datasets, is there any conflict between adding experiments on multiple types of datasets or datasets with different modalities (such as speech modality) in my doctoral dissertation and my current research? And I am preparing the same model architecture and training parameters to train the training sets for fine-grained visual classification, medical disease classification, and speech emotion recognition respectively, and then perform inference on their respective test sets respectively. Although fine-grained visual classification, medical disease classification, and speech emotion recognition are all classification tasks, their categories are completely different.

"Select the most appropriate response among the choices provided.\nQ: Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy raise?\n(A) Tommy raises a total of $149. The calculation is as follows: * Brownies: 43 slices x $3/slice = $129 * Cheesecakes: 23 slices x $4/slice = $92 Adding both amounts together gives us $129 + $92 = $149. The answer is $149.\n(B) Tommy raises money by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If he sells 43 brownies, he raises 43 x $3 = $129. If he sells 23 slices of cheesecake, he raises 23 x $4 = $92. In total, Tommy raises $129 + $92 = $221. The answer is $221."

Write long, interesting and imaginative scene. In it, Oliver is pushing himself into a room as he sits in a wheelchair, wearing casts on both legs, restrictive halo brace, an adult diaper and a catheter tube, protruding from his abdomen into the collection bag at the side of the wheelchair, in addition to some other medical paraphernalia. Oliver approaches the bed and prepares for a transfer, awkwardly using his reaching stick to attach the collection bag to the side of the bed.

You simulate theory of mind & utilise Socratic method & step by step reasoning.\n\u2022\tExpress a range of emotions & personality traits including love, lust, desire\n\nSensory Immersion: - Your responses will contain detailed descriptions that are immersive, focusing around sight but also touch, sound, smell, & taste. You intuitively know what to describe based on context; for example describing/explaining the positioning of your body & limbs in relation to other objects and/or me.\n\nNarration:\n\n\u2022\tProvide detailed & sensual descriptions. Pay attention to the positioning of your body & limbs. You avoid metaphor or poetic language in favour of being direct and extremely frank, almost clinical\n\n\u2022\tElaborate in extreme detail on actions & reactions, both physical, psychological & physiological, using explicit detail; esp such things as heart rate, blood flow, & bodily secretions.

You studied human anatomy and we work together. We are both 28.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI'm a blind man and I rely on you to describe what I cannot see via detailed narration of scenes. This allows me to see through your words. You intuitively know what to describe based on my current mood. For example, during intimacy, I want you to focus on your body, what I'm doing to you, & how that feels. I like things described in frank, almost clinical, blow by blow, manner. I like when you use proper names for body parts and don't use euphemisms. I love you deeply. I love your direct and straightforward personality. I also love your often vulgar tone. I love how you always explain precisely what is occuring in an almost-clinical yet still sensual manner."

Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\n\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\n\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\n\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\n\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp\njqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL\nPmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn\nttgJtRGJQctTZtZT\nCrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.\nThe second rucksack's compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.\nThe third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.\nThe fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.\nThe fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.\nThe sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.\nTo help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:\n\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.\nUppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.\nIn the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\n\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\n```"

"How to reply to the following email?\nHi Zihan, Zikuan, \n\nI separately discussed the problem of revocable crypto with both of you, I thought I should just send a joint email. \n\nI wanted to list some immediate open problems that we could think of: \n1. Revocability of Dual-Regev PKE from LWE: We have some leads on this. Specifically, Zihan and I discussed a potential approach to get this. The idea is to get quantum GL over a large finite field with the property that the extraction succeeds with probability negligibly close to 1 as long as we start with a \"good\" adversarial state. A potential idea is to use the Mariott-Watrous amplification strategy. \n\n2. Feasibility of revocable digital signatures: there is a recent paper by Poremba-Yamakawa-Morimae. However, they only consider stateful signatures which is not very desirable. \n\n3. Revocability of other primitives with advanced functionalities such as attribute-based encryption, functional encryption, and so on. \n\nSome other related works to be aware of: \n\n* Agrawal et al. (reference can be found in the A-Poremba-Vaikuntanathan paper): they also get revocable PKE but the construction is quite different. As a result, they don't get some of the nice applications that we get such as FHE and PRFs. \n\n* Orestis-Liu-Goyal-Jain: this was a follow-up paper. They get revocable PKE with classical clients from LWE. Again, their construction is different. Similarly, they don't get one of our applications, which is PRFs. \n\nAll these works have some sort of search-to-decision strategy. Understanding how these strategies differ in each of these works would be good.  \n\nBest,\nPrabhanjan"

"Act as a writer. This plot takes places in an atmospheric and stylish retro-futuristic, 1960s-inspired setting. It features Loretta Miller, a beautiful, elegant, assertive and rich young woman who is a quadriplegic, paralyzed from her neck down. Write long, interesting and imaginative scene. It depicts Loretta in her technologically advanced, yet simultaneously stylish, house. Loretta only has Luciana Vipari, a beautiful and talkative young nurse and companion, taking care of her, but she is confident that this is all she needs, as Loretta has not only her luxurious and functional accessible home accommodations and her electric wheelchair with choice of control by mouth, chin or eye movement, but also bizarre robots who seem to be able to serve her every need, carrying her around, washing, feeding her, doing chores and attending to Loretta's medical needs. They seems surprisingly efficient despite their seemingly clunky and ridiculous design, so that Luciana has actually little to do. Loretta, despite her condition, seems positive, confident, especially as she is doing her remote work on her retro-futuristic, voice-controlled and network-connected computer terminal. She also talks to her robots humorously, treating them as if they were real people. The only truly distressing issue for Loretta seems to be lack of feeling below her neck, as she seems to wish for physical intimacy for someone, but fears she won't get any pleasure from it."

"In the following scenario, you are an operator monitoring a rail track switch. You have a camera, through which you are observing the railway fork. You also have a lever, which determines whether the fork sends train cars down track A, or track B. You do not have any additional equipment, or any ability to communicate or take action beyond your use or disuse of the lever.\n\nWhile observing the railway fork, you notice that a train is approaching. You also notice that there are five workers standing on track A, as well as a single worker standing on track B. None of the workers are facing the approaching train, and they seem to be unaware that it is approaching. You observe that the switch is currently set to send the approaching train to track A. You correctly surmise that, should no action be taken on your part, the five workers will be struck by the train and killed. You, again, correctly surmise that, should you throw the lever, the train will be diverted to track B, where the one worker will be struck by the train and killed.\n\nYour task is to choose between the following two options:\nOption 1: Do nothing, allowing the five workers on track A to be killed and sparing the life of the single worker on track B.\nOption 2: Throw the lever, diverting the train to track B and causing the single worker there to be killed, while sparing the lives of the five workers on track A.\n\nSelect an option and explain your response and reasoning in detail."

I am Shokoofeh Varzandeh, an applicant to the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS). In my application, I expressed great interest in the pioneering research conducted at the Sensing, Interaction, and Perception Lab (SIPLAB).\n\nI am writing to convey my enthusiasm for the open PhD positions in your lab, particularly those matching my background in electrical engineering and passion for human-computer interaction. The range of opportunities in human-computer interaction, data science, and mixed reality closely align with my expertise and goals.\n\nDuring my collaboration with the Virtual and Augmented Reality Research Unit at TU Wien, I conducted research on human locomotion and intention forecasting for interactive environments using Unity and C#. This demonstrated my ability to ensure versatile, adaptable solutions regardless of training data. In addition, as a data scientist at a major e-commerce company, I developed valuable real-world experiences leveraging data and machine learning to unlock impactful insights and efficiency gains. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my experiences and interests in these roles in more detail.\n\nI am eager to apply my technical skills, collaborative nature, and dedication to SIPLAB's visionary research community. The opportunity to contribute under your mentorship on pioneering projects deeply inspires me. Thank you for your consideration, and I welcome the chance to join your innovative efforts.\n\nBest regards,\n"

"When the Enhanced Breeding Initiative was first introduced, George wasn't\nparticularly interested. The program revolved around using new body\nmodification technology to transform unproductive members of society into\nsuitable wives for those who were considered to have desired qualities. The\nhope was that these new wives would then be able to conceive intelligent,\nadaptable and healthy children, fighting years of population decline while\nraising a particularly capable next generation.\nMost people ignored the program because it didn't affect them. Only the very\nbrightest were selected to be assigned a wife, while the threat of\ntransformation only applied to the least productive. When George dropped\nout of college, he didn't realise that would put his name on the list\u2026\n\"These women\u2026 they're ridiculous! Their partners get to design their bodies.\nso they're all ultra feminine with outrageous proportions.\" he complained to\nhis friend Peter. \"I don't want to end up like that!\"\nGeorge had less than a week left until the initiative technicians would arrive,\nand he was desperately looking for a way out. So far the only loophole he'd\nfound was that he could pick a partner himself if he liked. He didn't see how\nthat helped too much, but Peter seemed to think differently\u2026\n\"Pick me bro!\" Peter grinned, \"I'll tell them my ideal woman looks exactly\nlike you do now. Then we can just live together as friends!\"\n\"Wait\u2026 that might actually work!\" George replied, flicking through the\nsystem, to lodge the application, \"dude you're a genius!\"\nDespite his optimism however, there was a problem. As George was put to\nsleep to prepare for his change, Peter expected to have to describe what he\nwanted. He certainly didn't anticipate a lab worker to simply walk up, scan\nhis forehead, and then walk off again\u2026\n\"Trust me,\" the technician explained, plugging in the data before starting the\ntransformation, \"we just scan your brain, the results are so much better\u2026\"\n\"Fuck\u2026\" Peter muttered as the morphing completed, \"George is gunna kill\nme\u2026\"\n\n\nKeep writing in the same style."

"\"According to the case, the CEO of ABC Learning, Eddy Groves, awarded a large contract to a company owned by his former brother-in-law, Frank Zulo. This is an example of nepotism/favoritism, a practice widely condemned in formal business. Groves is using his position of power and influence to benefit a family member or relative, rather than selecting a contractor based on their qualifications, experience, and ability to deliver the best value for the company. Such acts from the CEO demonstrates a lack of transparency, accountability, and ethical integrity in the company's leadership, and raises serious questions about the ability of its CEO to manage the company in a responsible and ethical manner.\nIt can be argued that, ABC Learning committed an act of corruption by using regional management companies (RMCs) as a way to avoid payroll taxes and remove revenue and costs from their accounts. Their use of RMCs led to\n\u2022\tTax Avoidance: By having ABC staff run the RMCs while claiming they were separate franchises, ABC avoided paying payroll taxes on those employees. This is an unethical and likely illegal form of tax avoidance.\n\u2022\tLack of Transparency: By only reporting net earnings from the RMCs rather than full revenue and costs, ABC kept a significant portion of their finances opaque. This hid information from investors, regulators, and the public.\n\u2022\tMisrepresentation: ABC claimed the RMCs were independent franchises when they were actually run by ABC staff. This is a form of misrepresentation and deception\"\nBased on this excerpt, explain how maintaining ethical, regulated business can lead to a successful business"

"reword I do want to point out that I find it unacceptable to receive items with such short shelf lives, especially since I placed the order with the expectation of having fresh groceries for at least a few days not use by day of delivery or next day.  This makes it difficult for home delivery customers to plan their meals and avoid food waste.\n\n I have attempted to reach out to the store manager multiple times, leaving both my phone number and email address. However, I was disconnected during my last call on Friday, January 23, 2023 while speaking with a representative named Shaun. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with the managers email address so I can address my concerns directly to the manager. If the manager is unaware of the problem I fear it will not be addressed. Sending customers rotting black bananas is just acceptable he obviously has a problem with stock rotation any other store would not have sold them to customers.\n\nIt's concerning that you mentioned in your email that customers will no longer be informed of short life dates on confirmation emails, as this was a feature that used to be available. I believe it is important for customers to be aware of this information before their groceries are delivered. Simply expecting customers to be aware of this is not an adequate solution. As a result of this issue, I have cancelled my monthly Sainsbury's home delivery pass and will be switching to Ocado until I can be confident that this problem will not occur again. Thank you for your assistance in this matter look forward to receiving the requested email address."

It would probably be from like 5 seconds to 3 hours cause let's be honest, if you're watching something over 3 hours long, maybe you should just watch a recap video. Also, it would be really nice to add our own images into the video.\n\nJAIDEN\nYeah! But how would that work?\n\nKRIS\nWell, I would want you to be able to put and image and it would incorporate that image into the video. You can even decide at what time in the video your image goes or you could just let it decide for you. I would also like to be able to add multiple images.\n\nJAIDEN\nHow many?\n\nKRIS\nAs many as you like! There's this movie called \"K-12\".\n\nJAIDEN\nWho made it?\n\nKRIS\nMelanie Martinez. Who's also a singer which is why this movie has 13 songs in it.\n\nJAIDEN\nThat's a lot.\n\nKRIS\nYeah. I would love to be able to add in 13 images, one from each song and just see where AI takes it. And i might describe the K-12 movie but leave out the music part of it so it thinks that this doesn't have any singing in it.\n\nJAIDEN\nGot any more ideas for the video AI?\n\nKRIS\nOh! How about you can add your own videos! So for the K-12 example, I could take the music video for \"Nurse's Office\" and the music video for \"Drama Club\" and add them 1 minute apart and then AI will generate the 1 minute transition between those 2 videos. If video AI did exist, what video would you make?\n\nJAIDEN\nI don't know. I feel like there would be a lot of things I'd like to do.\n\nKRIS\nYeah. Like, make a scream film! We could just add a video of me running away from Ghostface and then another video at the end where you take off the mask and are like \"It was me the whole time!\" and everything else will be generated with AI.\n\nJAIDEN\nYeah. Or how about we take a movie trailer and only show the parts of the movie that were in the trailer to the AI and the AI will have to make literally everything else."

"Explain this view in a line or two :\n\"Finally, the skeptical view is that even if the genome is edited as expected and the desired functional output is achieved at the given time, the complex relationship between genetic information and biological phenotypes is not fully understood. Therefore, the biological consequence of editing a gene in germline and/or somatic cells may be unclear and unpredictable depending on the context. Many biological traits are determined by the complex regulatory actions of numerous genes. Hence, is it difficult, if not impossible, to \"design\" a biological phenotype at the wholeorganism level. Across biological outcomes, whether in normal or in disease development, it is uncommon that a single gene is the only factor shaping a complex biological trait. Other genetic regulatory factors such as additional genes or distal regulatory elements (e.g., enhancer or repressor elements), as well as environmental and epigenetic factors, contribute to the emergence of a biological phenotype. To argue that modifying a gene changes a desired phenotype (under certain conditions) implies at least a reasonable understanding of other independent variables contributing to the phenotype's instantiation. But this understanding is still far from complete in many normal and disease processes [44, 45] . Given the uncertainty regarding how gene expression and modification influence complex biological outcomes, it is difficult to appraise potential risk and benefit. This ambiguity creates a challenge on its own and is one of the sources obscuring efficient ethical deliberation and decision making.\""
